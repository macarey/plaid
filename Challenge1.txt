Hi Amy,



Thanks for reaching out! The difference between a public token and an access token is primarily in their duration. Public tokens are ephemeral, meaning they only last a short amount of 
time.   These tokens are provided when an item is created and their purpose is to be exchanged for a longer living access token.  These access tokens are then affilited with the item 
and can access product data on that specific item, and that item only.  You can exchange tokens by calling the /item/public_token/exchange endpoint.  In regards to your initial issue involving item creation, if you are getting an INVALID_CREDENTIALS error, you most likely have not included your public_key in the payload of your request.  This key can be found at https://dashboard.plaid.com/account/keys.  Documentation regarding item creation can be found at https://plaid.com/docs/#integrating-with-link. 

If your issues persist, please respond with the details of the API call you are making, as well as the environment you are working in (Sandbox/Development/Production).  This will allow me to provide more specific assistance. 

Cheers,
